## TrumpTwitterArchive
Trump's use of Twitter for propaganda, promotion, and communication is unprecedented for the Presidency.  He is an active user of twitter, and the trumptwitterarchive is a collection of his every tweet, retweet, and favorite.  
"David S. Ferriero informed two Democratic senators last week that the Trumpâ€™s tweets are being preserved for posterity, so future generations can revel in the president's peculiar and unprecedented use of Twitter as an art form and governing tool." -source theVerge

Problem Statement:  Predict engagement levels based on text, hastags, sentiment, and other feature columns.  

Hypothesis and Assumptions:
    - Build a model that predicts the level of engagement for the President's tweets
    - Target Engagement (y), which is defined as the combination of favorite_count + retweet_count
    - Feature Columns: ['source', 'text', 'created_at', 'is_retweet']
    - Additional Feature Columns from Text:
      Create a sentiment score on Text.  Does negative sentiment increase engagement?
      Create Dummy variables for commonly used hashtags, which ones increase engagement?
      
Challenges to this exercise include the use of NLP and JSON.  Although the website does allow a CSV extract of data, it will probably be a bit more interesting to configure this project for a real time feed to monitor engagements and changing trends.
